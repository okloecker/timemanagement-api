All endpoints return JSON documents in the same general format.

For good results (HTTP codes 2xx), they will have a key "data" and the return
value object, e.g. an updated object from a POST, PUT or DELETE operation or a
single object or array from GET operations.
Additionally, there can be a "warning" key, containing more information, e.g. a
POST passed, but there were time overlaps.
An optional "message" key has a human readable value like "Login successful."

In the case of errors, instead of a "data" key there will be an "error" key.
Validation errors will have a "validation" object below the "error", containing
an array of key/value mappings, where each entry will be a failed validation,
e.g. the result of a form value error.

All GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls return an object with:
{ data: {
    ...
  },
  message: ""
}

or

{ data: [
    ...
  ],
  message: ""
}

or

{ data: [
    ...
  ],
  warning: {
    overlap: [...]
  }
}

or 
{ error: {
    validation: [
      ...
    ]
  }
}

or 
{ error: {
    ...
  }
}


or 
{ error: {
    message: ""
  }
}
